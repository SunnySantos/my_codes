<h2>One Month Before the Move</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Look at the medical records of your family, your children's school records, and the veterinary records of your pets. Take them with you in a binder or other easy-to-access organizer.</li>
 	<li>Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian if your pet needs an immunization update.</li>
 	<li>Make sure you get rid of the items you won't be taking with you. Make sure all items you wish to donate to charity go in one place, all items you wish to give away to friends, neighbours, and family go in another, and all items you wish to sell go in the trash.</li>
 	<li>Make sure you have all the packing supplies you need. Boxes and supplies are often provided for free by removalists. Start packing holiday decorations and off-season clothes you don't use often.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two Weeks Before the Move</p>

 	<li>Australia Post should be notified of your change of address.</li>

 	<li>Check with your removalist to ensure that your reservation is accurate.</li>

 	<li>When you arrive, prepare a special box or boxes of things you'll need. It should be clearly labelled, and the removalists should place it at the beginning of the unpacking process.</li>
 	<li>When you move, hire a caregiver to take care of your kids, pets, or elderly family members.</li>
 	<li>Payment of your bills and return of borrowed items are important.</li>
